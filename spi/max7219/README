The capture was generated using PulseView.

The chip was driven by an FTDI FT232H connected to USB, using a custom Perl
program to drive the signals, including the intentional error cases.

MAX7219 settings:
  Number of daisy-chained chips = 4

The capture was generated using PulseView.

The chip was driven by an Arduino UNO connected to USB, using code from here:
